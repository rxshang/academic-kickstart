  •	Trained a set of ML models (e.g. KNN, SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.) on waste input and biogas output data to build a predictive model that help biogas facilities enhance their operational productivity.  model was applied to an open-source Python-based web application.
  •	Collaborated with new researchers to train and optimize the previously proposed machine learning predictive system with larger available data for better results.
  •	Used NLP models to explore trends in patent innovation activity related to fertilizers for global agriculture.
